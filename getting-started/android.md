## Installation from Google Play

On Android devices, AuthPass is available in the Play Store at [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=design.codeux.authpass](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=design.codeux.authpass).



Note: in Google Play, advanced users can join the beta program to get pre-releases of the app.

## Advanced Users Only: Installation using APK

{% hint style="warning" %}
Using APK installation is recommended for advanced users because AuthPass updates such as security updates, bugfixes and new features will not be available easily. We recommend using the Play Store method above. 
{% endhint %}

Follow these steps to install AuthPath using the APK file:

1. Download the latest release for Android [here](https://github.com/authpass/authpass/releases/latest/).

    \(e.g.  `authpass-sideload-X.X.X_XXXX.apk` \).

2. Open the APK file and follow the on-screen instructions to install.
