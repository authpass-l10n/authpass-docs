## About

AuthPass is a stand alone password manager with support for the popular and proven [KeePass](https://keepass.info/help/base/index.html) password database format \(`kdbx 3.x` and `kdbx 4.x`\).

AuthPass stores all your passwords encrypted using a primary passphrase. You need to remember the primary passphrase to decrypt the password database. Learn more about the password database and the encryption used [here](https://keepass.info/help/kb/kdbx_4.html).

By default, all your password databases will be stored on your local devices and will not be sent to any cloud server. This way you and no one else is in control of all your password databases.

## Features
