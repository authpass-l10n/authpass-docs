## About

AuthPass is a stand alone password manager with support for the popular and proven [KeePass](https://keepass.info/help/base/index.html) password database format \(`kdbx 3.x` and `kdbx 4.x`\).

AuthPass stores all your passwords encrypted using a primary passphrase. You need to remember the primary passphrase to decrypt the password database. Learn more about the password database and the encryption used [here](https://keepass.info/help/kb/kdbx_4.html).

By default, all your password databases will be stored on your local devices and will not be sent to any cloud server. This way you and no one else is in control of all your password databases.

## Features

* Truly cross-platform with releases available for ðŸ“± smartphones \(running Android or iOS\) and for ðŸ’» computers \(running Windows, macOS and even Linux\).
* Beautiful UI with dark-mode support written in Flutter.
* Secure random password generator with variable number of characters.
* Support for opening multiple password databases at the same time \(e.g. work and personal\).
* Native support for storing and sharing password database in your own cloud storage \(Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive and WebDAV\).
