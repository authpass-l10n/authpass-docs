You may enter any name of your choice for the database. After that set a secure master password to protect your database.

It is highly recommended to set a long master password consisting of alphabets of both cases, digits, and special characters.

### From the selection screen

Click on the "Create New File" button if you are on the "AuthPass - Select KeyPass file"  screen as shown.
